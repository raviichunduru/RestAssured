This project showcases how to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, and UPDATE) to APIs. It also covers various ways to construct request bodies, including:

Passing as String: You can directly include the request body as a string.
Reading from External Files (Static Content): Load the request body from an external file (e.g., JSON, XML, or plain text).
Dynamic Content Modification: Read from an external file and modify specific string values before sending the request.
Using Maps: Store request parameters as key-value pairs in a map and pass them to the request body.
External JSON Library: Utilize an external JSON library to manage request data.
